##Twipy

Twipy is a little Python script that I use to monitor a Twitter Timeline for
the hashtag ```#waterMe``` 
If it finds the hashtag, Twipy waters my garden for the specified number
of minutes, deletes the tweet, and sends me a message to let me know what it's
done.

## Motivation

This program provides a lightweight, functional means of watering my garden with
simple and powerful commands. The service is also available from anywhere I can
access Twitter.

## Installation and Running

You'll need to fill in the TwitterLogin.py file with the appropriate keys and
secrets so that the program will have access to the Twitter account's timeline.

\#waterMe can be located anywhere in the tweet, but the optional positive 
integer must follow the hashtag with a single space in between the two.
